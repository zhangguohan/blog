Postgres-XL添加GTM_slave


先添加gtm_proxy节点


PGXC add gtm_proxy gtm_pxy1 sdw01 7777 /usr/local/pgxl-9.5/data/gtm_pxy.1
Initializing gtm proxy gtm_pxy1.
The files belonging to this GTM system will be owned by user "pgxl".
This user must also own the server process.

注意：只存在gtm_proxy节点才能实现gtm故障转移条件 并且以上所有coord及datanode节点连接到gtm_proxy 可以分别使用多个不同的gtm_proxy， 另外gtm_proxy是不保存数据，gtm_proxy故障可可以通过重启恢复。
