## How Democrats are handing Donald Trump a viable path to a second term(民主党如何提供为一条可以连接任的方法)

Donald Trump is by all measures,going to have a very difficult time winning a  second term next November. He lost the popular vote in 2016 by almost 3 million votes.

And yet,in the last two weeks, Democrats have handed Trump  tow issues on a golden platter and it`s already clear he is seizing on them.Bigly

然而，在过去的两周里，民主党人将特朗普的两个问题交给了一个金盘子 - 而且已经很明显他正在抓住这些问题。

1) In New York, Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed into law the Reproductive Heath Act,which, among other things,takes the word "abortion" out of the State`s criminal code,ensure that doctors and clinics who provide cant`t be charaged and codifies that abortions can be performed after 24 weeks if the fetus is not viable or the mother`s health is at serious risk.

Conservative critics -- in New york and elsewhere painted the law as overbroad adn effectively legalizing abortion not only in the third trimester,but all the way to birth
 


```
在纽约，民主党州长安德鲁·科莫（Andrew Cuomo）签署了“生殖健康法”（Reproductive Health Act）的法律，除其他外，该法案将“堕胎”一词排除在州的刑法之外，确保提供堕胎的医生和诊所不能被起诉和 如果胎儿不能存活或母亲的健康处于严重风险中，则可以在24周后进行堕胎。 保守派批评者 - 在纽约和其他地方 - 将法律描述为过度宽泛，并且不仅在妊娠晚期有效地使堕胎合法化，而且一直到出生
```

Just as that was happening,virginia Gov .Ralph Northam Went on a local radio station and tried to explain his support for legislation that would have loosened current strictures on late-term abortions in the commonwealth.

```
就在这一切发生的时候，弗吉尼亚州州长拉尔夫·诺瑟姆(Ralph Northam，民主党)在当地一家广播电台上解释说，他支持通过一项立法，放松联邦目前对晚期堕胎的限制
